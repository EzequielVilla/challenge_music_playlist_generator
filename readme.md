## Rust Challenge: Music Playlist Generator

This Rust challenge focuses on generating music playlists. You must implement at least one design pattern and utilize traits, boxes, or hashmaps.

**Problem:**

Design and implement a music playlist generator that meets the following requirements:

1. **Music Library:**
   - Represent a music library containing songs with various attributes like title, artist, genre, duration, and release year.
   - Implement methods to add, remove, search, and filter songs based on different criteria.
2. **Playlist Generation:**
   - Define various playlist generation strategies based on user preferences, such as:
     - **Most popular songs:** Generate a playlist featuring the most popular songs based on a defined metric (e.g., play count, user ratings).
     - **Genre-specific playlists:** Create playlists featuring songs from specific genres or a combination of genres.
     - **Similar artist playlists:** Generate playlists featuring artists similar to a selected artist.
   - Each strategy should be implemented as a separate module or type to ensure modularity and maintainability.
3. **User Interaction:**
   - Allow users to interact with the playlist generator by:
     - Selecting desired playlist generation strategies.
     - Providing additional filtering criteria for each strategy (e.g., minimum song duration, release year range).
     - Viewing generated playlists and exporting them to different formats (e.g., text file, audio player playlist).

**Design Patterns:**

- **Strategy pattern:** Implement different playlist generation strategies as separate modules or types to allow flexibility and future expansion.

**Additional Requirements:**

- Utilize appropriate data structures like `HashMap`, `Vec`, or custom types to efficiently represent and manage music library data.
- Leverage traits to define common functionalities for different types of music library elements (e.g., songs, artists).
- Employ boxes or other appropriate techniques to manage dynamic object creation and references.
- Implement unit tests to ensure the correctness and functionality of your code.

**Bonus:**

- Implement a system for saving and loading user-defined playlists and preferences.
- Integrate with external music platforms or APIs to access streaming services or music libraries.
- Enhance the user interface with interactive features and visualizations.

**Focus:**

This challenge aims to assess your ability to:

- Design and implement a modular and extensible software architecture using design patterns.
- Leverage traits and data structures effectively for managing complex data.
- Implement user interaction and data persistence mechanisms.
- Test your code for correctness and functionality.
